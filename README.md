# Enhancing-Contextual-Accuracy-in-LLM-Responses-Using-Ollama-s-PDF-Based-Retrieval-System
This project demonstrates how to integrate and test PDF-based retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) using Ollama and the LLaMA2 model. It showcases how document-specific responses improve the accuracy, specificity, and contextual relevance of answers, particularly for sensitive domains like privacy and security.

🔧 Setup and Configuration
1. Environment Setup
Install and configure Ollama

Load a target PDF (e.g., Privacy Concerns with Large Language Model Testing) into the knowledge base

Use LLaMA2 as the base model

Tailor prompts to encourage document-relevant answers

2. Testing Process
Execute identical queries with and without PDF retrieval

Compare response specificity and completeness

🧪 Sample Evaluation Queries
Query	With Retrieval	Without Retrieval
Privacy risks in LLMs	✅ Detailed (e.g., model poisoning, inference attacks)	⚠️ Generic (e.g., data bias, privacy)
Data protection techniques	✅ Includes differential privacy, federated learning	⚠️ Mentions only general methods
Contextual privacy issues	✅ In-depth with examples	⚠️ Lacks specific threats

📈 Performance Summary
Relevance: Responses with PDF retrieval scored up to 10/10 on relevance and specificity

Accuracy: Enabled accurate responses for complex topics like inference attacks, jailbreak risks, and safety fine-tuning

User Trust: Retrieval-based answers increased trustworthiness and usability

🚀 Benefits
Context-rich, regulation-aware answers

Applicable in legal, healthcare, and technical documentation

Enhances learning and onboarding experiences

Reduces need for manual document lookup

⚠️ Known Limitations
Multi-section synthesis for complex queries needs improvement

Retrieval-based models require better prompt engineering for seamless integration

📌 Future Enhancements
Adaptive retrieval depth based on query complexity

Improved synthesis of cross-sectional content

Optimized prompt templates for hybrid-topic queries
